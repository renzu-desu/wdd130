        <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! My name is Renz and I am from the Philippines. I always dream to be developer,
            but I don't have the courage to take the risk, it took me years to finally decided to enroll on this,
            course. So, come with me as I begin this journey of learning how to be a developer. I snippits of who
            I am, I am introvert who loves outdoor solo activities. I enjoy running, hiking, and biking. I also love
            reading a newly found habit of me, I am more of like a listiner than a talker. I am excited to share more of
            me on this website, so stay tuned!
