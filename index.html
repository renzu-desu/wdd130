        Hello! My name is Renz and I am from the Philippines. I always dream to
        be developer, but I don't have the courage to take the risk, it took me
        years to finally decided to enroll in this, course. So, come with me as
        I begin this journey of learning how to be a developer. I snippits of
        who I am, I am introvert who loves outdoor solo activities. I enjoy
        running, hiking, and biking. I also love reading a newly found habit of
        me, I am more of like a listiner than a talker. I am excited to share
        more of me on this website, so stay tuned!
